# CURE4-Machine-Learning-Model

In our confusion matrix, we have two true values labelled “Female Female” and “Male Male”. These values signify that our predicted values and true values are the same. We also have two false values labelled “Male Female” and “Female Male”. These values signify that our predicted values and true values are different. From this, we can deduce that there are 10 females and 20 males. Of the 10 female data points, our confusion matrix correctly predicted 5 values. Of the 20 male data points, our confusion matrix correctly predicted 14 of the data points. This means that our model correctly identifies female data 50% (5/10) of the time, while it correctly identifies male data 70% (14/20) of the time. This tells us that our model is not always accurate when comparing predicted values and true values, and that it is more accurate when identifying male data.
